# Calculator

A calculator for the browser created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
It has the normal operations: addition, subtraction, divising and multiplication. 

It has a dark and a light mode which can be changed at will.

The clear button will reset the calculation whilst the erase button will remove the latest digit (or point) from it.

Works for keyboard input using the numpad and the point (.) key. 
Equals (=) can be done by pressing the enter key.

Try it out in the [live demo](https://nudd3.github.io/calculator/)
